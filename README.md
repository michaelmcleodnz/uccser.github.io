# UCCSER Documentation

Welcome to the developer guide for the University of Canterbury Computer Science Education Research Group, or UCCSER for short.
This guide is a series of documentation pages to inform you how the UCCSER projects are structured and managed, the requirements for working on these projects, and our expectations of you.
This documentation is both for contributors and our own staff and students to assist in the onboarding process.

## Notes

- The Code of Conduct and Contributing files are located in a different repository, so these can be picked up as the [default files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) for our repositories.
- The documentation is written in Markdown using the MkDocs framework.
  You can install the required dependency using the `requirements.txt` file, and then running `mkdocs serve` to view the documentation locally.
