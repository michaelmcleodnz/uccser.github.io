# Issue Management

We use GitHub for tracking issues

Our policy is to only assign a person to an issue when they are actively working on the issue.
Don't assign yourself when you *plan* to do the task (for example: in the next few days), assign yourself when you begin work.
This allows other team members to clearly see which tasks are available to be worked on.

To see a list of issues you are currently assigned to see [this GitHub page](https://github.com/issues/assigned).
