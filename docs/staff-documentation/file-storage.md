# File Storage

The UCCSER group uses Google Drive and associated apps for creating files.
This is because we work with a lot of third parties that use Google product (include Google employees).

The University of Canterbury can setup your work email (`@canterbury.ac.nz`) with access to the UC CSSE Google Drive.
You will need to talk to a staff member about getting this done for your account.

The University of Canterbury uses Microsoft Teams/Office by default, so some CSSE department files may be stored here.
