# Getting Started

This documentation is to help get started within the UCCSER team.
Here are some tasks we recommend doing:

- Read the sections of this documentation relevant to your position.
- Setup Slack and your profile.
- Familise yourself with [our projects](../contribution-documentation/projects.md).

If you are joining in a technical position and unsure where to begin contributing, we recommend looking through a project's issue tracker for tasks that interest you.
Each developer will generally have one or two main tasks they are working towards, but we encourage working on a few side issues if you like have a variety of tasks to do.
