# Mission

*The mission of University of Canterbury Computer Science Education Research Group is to create quality educational resources and platforms that empower and support teachers internationally, based on and continually enhancing academic research and community engagement.*

Our team focuses on people first.
We believe and work to focus on people, connecting and supporting them.
In a te ao Māori worldview this is whakawhanaungatanga.
Our connections and care for people enables us to have strong relationships with everyone we work alongside and support.

We believe in Manaakitanga, which goes well beyond hospitality and focuses on looking after people and growing their confidence and sense of self-worth.

Our team embraces the opportunities that come from collaboration and know that more comes from supporting others than protecting what’s seen as a competitive edge.

We publish our content open source to allow our creations to be shared with as many people as possible.
We encourage others to adapt and expand the projects we have created.
