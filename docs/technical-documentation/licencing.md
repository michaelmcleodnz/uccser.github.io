# Licencing

Our approach with licencing as follows:

- Share our content freely
- We require attribution
- We require sharing under similar licence

For some projects we allow commerical use, as this allows some unique situations to occur.
For example, a group may wish to charge entry to an in-person CS Unplugged showcase.
While allowing commerical use may others to legally sell a copy of our projects for a profit, we ensure our free projects are easily discoverable.

The two main licenses we use are:

- **For code:** [MIT Licence](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
- **For content:** [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

Any third-party libraries or packages used within this project should include licence files or be attributed where applicable.

Licencing is hard and complicated but do your best to point out what licences apply for areas of a project.
