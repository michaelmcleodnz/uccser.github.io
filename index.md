### Computer Science for High Schools Event (CS4HS)

Website: [cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/cs4hs](http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/cs4hs)  

We organise the largest CS4HS conference in New Zealand for secondary school teachers to learn about computer science and programming, and how to teach it in their schools. In 2014, we had 120 teachers travel to Christchurch for the 3 day intensive conference.

### Computer Science for Primary Schools Event (CS4PS)

Website: [cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/cs4ps](http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/cs4ps)  

CS4PS is a primary school version of the CS4HS event, to help primary school teachers prepare for the new DT curriculum. It is currently focussed on supporting local primary schools who are early adopters with the new curriculum.
